## AI-Assisted Smart Contract Vulnerability Analysis

### Overview
This repository is part of a time-boxed personal experiment.

**Experiment goal:**  
Complete and publish a minimal, AI-assisted analysis of a publicly disclosed smart contract vulnerability.

**Experiment duration:**  
10 days (fixed, non-extendable)

---

### Scope & Principles
- Based strictly on **publicly disclosed vulnerabilities**
- Focus on **structural understanding and root cause analysis**
- **No exploit development**
- **No attack reproduction**
- **No private or undisclosed information**

This experiment prioritizes:
- Completion over perfection  
- Clarity over depth  
- Traceable output over internal understanding  

---

### Methodology
1. Select one publicly disclosed smart contract vulnerability
2. Use AI tools to assist in understanding:
   - Vulnerability category
   - Root cause
   - Logical failure point
3. Re-articulate findings in structured human-readable form
4. Extract defensive insights

---

### Deliverables
- One complete vulnerability analysis document
- Clear identification of:
  - Vulnerability pattern
  - Root cause
  - Defensive takeaway
- Public timestamped record of completion
